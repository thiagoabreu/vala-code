## Vala Language Support for Visual Studio Code 

## Contributing

There are a few things I need help:

- More code snippets
- A Language Server (for better formating and autocomplete)

If you wanna discuss any of them, feel free to send me a email or open a issue.

The image icon comes from the [Moka Icon Theme](https://github.com/moka-project/moka-icon-theme) by Sam Hewitt.
